## [Usage](#usage)
  After cloning the repo onto your local machine, you can use the generator by going through the following steps:
1. Run `cd Develop/` in your cli.
2. Run `node index.js` and it will begin the first question.
3. Hit enter/ return after you are finished answering each question and it will prompt with the next one. 

Please note that some of the questions will open up an editor mode in your cli. Those questions will present a subtext saying “Press <enter> to launch your 
preferred editor.” When you encounter these types of questions, do the following:
1. Hit enter/ return to enter into editor mode.
2. Once in editor mode, type `i` — this will allow you to insert whatever text you want.
3. When you are finished adding your text, hit `esc` and then type `:wq` to save and exit the editor mode. You will then return to the prompts.
